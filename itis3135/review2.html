    <h3>Pros</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Homepage clearly communicates the purpose: helping UNCC students discover events and resources.</li>
        <li>Featured events section uses images effectively to highlight important campus activities.</li>
        <li>Quick Links provide easy access to key pages like “Upcoming Events” and “Campus Resources.”</li>
        <li>Navigation menu is straightforward and consistent across pages.</li>
        <li>Text is readable, and spacing between sections keeps the page uncluttered.</li>
        <li>The “About” and “Contact” sections are easy to locate, giving the site credibility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Constructive Suggestions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Featured Events images could use captions or short descriptions for more context.</li>
        <li>Quick Links could stand out more visually, perhaps with hover effects or subtle background shading.</li>
        <li>Consider adding more color contrast between headings and the background to improve accessibility.</li>
        <li>Some images on the homepage are small; slightly larger or consistent sizing would improve the layout.</li>
        <li>Adding a footer with social links or navigation repetition could improve overall site navigation.</li>
        <li>The “About Sankalp” page title might be confusing for first-time visitors; consider a title more clearly aligned with the site’s purpose.</li>
    </ul>
