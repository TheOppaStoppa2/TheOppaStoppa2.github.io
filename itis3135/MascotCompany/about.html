        <h2>About Super Kangaroo</h2>
        <p><strong>Super Kangaroo</strong> started with a simple idea: backpacks and gear should be as adaptable and reliable as the people who use them. Inspired by the kangaroo’s pouch, our designs focus on maximizing storage without sacrificing style or comfort.</p>
        <p>Each product is thoughtfully crafted to support everyday life as well as weekend adventures. From waterproof materials to ergonomic straps, Super Kangaroo ensures you’re always ready for the next leap forward.</p>
