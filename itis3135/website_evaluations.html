            <h3><a href="https://www.b-egg.farm/" target="_blank">B-Egg Farm</a></h3>
            <p>The B-Egg Farm website is a clean, modern, and visually appealing site that highlights fresh eggs, sustainability, and local farming. The design feels welcoming and easy to navigate.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The site uses good color contrast with a white background and bold black text, paired with high-quality images that pop.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Fonts, colors, and button styles are consistent throughout the site, reinforcing brand identity.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything is neatly aligned in grids, making the content easy to read and scan.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related content (like product details and images) are grouped together logically, avoiding clutter.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
            <h3><a href="http://www.seiryu-kan.com/" target="_blank">Seiryu-Kan</a></h3>
            <p>The Seiryu-Kan website is confusing and outdated. It is difficult to read, has poor structure, and lacks a clear sense of design hierarchy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Low contrast colors make the text hard to read against the background.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Styles and formatting are inconsistent, with different fonts and random design elements across pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Content often looks scattered with no clear grid, making it visually overwhelming.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Unrelated elements are crammed together, while important information is spread too far apart, creating confusion.</li>
            </ul>
