    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Sankalp Kumar. I am a computer science major 
    and I plan to graduate Spring 2027(fingers crossed I did not mess up something). 
    I enjoy playing basketball and scrolling on reels. My concentration is in data science. I
     love numbers and being able to combine it with my passion for computers, 
     it's like peanut butter and jelly for me. I don’t know what else you guys 
     need to know about me.</p>

    <h3>Personal Background</h3>
    <p>I was born in Pune, India in 2006 and spent 6 years moving around India in all different 
        places. Then when I was 6-7 years old me and my family moved here. I lived in 
        different cities in New Jersey for 10 years. I love it in New Jersey. 
        I enjoy the beach and I love sunsets. Something really meaningful about the day 
        ending and knowing it will happen again.
